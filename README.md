# GenAI-RAG-Assistant

#GenAI RAG Assistant

This project is a Generative AI-powered Assistant that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with conversational intelligence to provide accurate, contextual, and human-like responses.

The assistant works by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and then using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate natural and meaningful answers. It can be extended for multiple use cases such as customer support, personal productivity, learning assistant, and enterprise knowledge management.

Key Features

RAG Pipeline → Improves accuracy by combining document retrieval with LLM responses.
Generative AI → Produces natural and context-aware answers.
Extensible Design → Can be adapted for different domains (IT, Education, Business, etc.).
User-Friendly → Simple interface for seamless interaction.

Future Enhancements

Integration with APIs and external data sources.
Multi-modal support (text + images + documents).
Deployment with Docker, Streamlit, or FastAPI for scalability.
