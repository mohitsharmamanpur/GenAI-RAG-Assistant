Docker Notes and Best Practices

1. Dockerfile Optimization:
   - Always start with a lightweight base image (e.g., python:3.9-slim)
   - Use multi-stage builds to reduce final image size
   - Clean up unnecessary packages and caches in the same RUN layer

2. Container Management:
   - Use docker ps to list running containers
   - Use docker logs <container-id> to debug application issues
   - Restart policy: Use --restart unless-stopped to auto-restart containers

3. Networking:
   - Default bridge network isolates containers
   - Use user-defined bridge networks for easier DNS resolution between containers
   - Example: docker network create mynet

4. Volumes:
   - Use volumes for persistent data: docker volume create data_volume
   - Mount with: docker run -v data_volume:/app/data myimage

5. Security:
   - Run containers as non-root users whenever possible
   - Keep images updated with security patches
   - Use docker scan to check for vulnerabilities
